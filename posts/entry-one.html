                        <p>I had just finished my freshman robotics year, and in that time I worked with a complex
                        piece of software called RoadRunner. RoadRunner used many different libraries and systems
                        to make a reliable odometry system. Odometry put simply is using a set of sensors to know how
                        far a robot or other object has moved. It made a lot of my job easier while I was using it,
                        so I decided to start implementing a similar structure into my own software.
                        <br><br>
                        My first iterations of this library were... rough to say the least. They were riddled with bugs
                        and overall signs that I didn't quite know what I was doing or what I wanted. Naming conventions
                        weren't all there, and I didn't quite know how I wanted to list version numbers or what features
                        I wanted to add.</p>
                        <h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">Finding the library's place</h3>
                        <img class="w-67 float-left mr-4 mb-3" src="../img/blog-1.png" alt="Image">
                        <p>Eventually, I realised I wouldn't be able to make this completely from scratch as I had
                        hoped. I started incorporating popular third-party libraries such as the
                        <a href="https://acmerobotics.github.io/ftc-dashboard/">FTC Dashboard</a> and I worked out what
                        features I wanted to incorporate and develop. At this time it was still very unrefined, but I
                        was proud of myself for getting as far as I had. I had made a basic system for a functioning
                        drivebase of various types and a versatile mostly-working telemetry system. There was still a
                        long way to go for it to be perfect, but it was good enough at this state that I was confident
                        in putting it into our own software base.</p>
