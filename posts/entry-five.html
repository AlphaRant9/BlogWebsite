                        <p>My first two years of high school were mainly learning. During my freshman year, I didn't
                        have any sort of library for my own code and it made programming take much longer. However,
                        my freshman year did introduce me to more complicated code libraries and gave me the idea to
                        make my library. My sophomore year was the early start of the library, where it was rough and
                        poorly designed to be honest. It was functional, but could definitely be improved.</p>
                        <h2 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">Junior and Senior Year</h2>
                        <img class="w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-3" src="../img/blog-5.jpg" alt="Image">
                        <p>My junior year was when things really took off. It was the year with the most complicated
                        software I'd ever had to write. It required laser precision, so naturally my library got much
                        better. I modularised to prevent damage to the robot, and also made my initial odometry library
                        which worked much better than expected for being an alpha piece of software.
                        <br><br>
                        Over summer 2023 I took off with improvements, modularising and making our code better. This
                        allowed me to write much better code for my senior year, and we even almost made it to worlds
                        because of it. I even became able to incorporate similar functions and structure into the FRC
                        codebase, helping us code that more efficiently as well. Now I am a lot farther along with
                        my programming skills than I could have dreamed of as a freshman, and now I am looking to
                        further improve.</p>
